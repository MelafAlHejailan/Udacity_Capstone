## Getting Started

Application hosted on Heroku

## Development Setup
Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the development server:

```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
Setting the FLASK_ENV variable to development will detect file changes and restart the server automatically. Setting the FLASK_APP variable to app.py directs flask to run app.py and run the application.
